# NZ-Resistance
New Zealand Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Pipeline

This pipeline is intended to be used within New Zealand for clinical purposes.

This pipeline will perform variant calling on raw sequences, and identify
drug-conferring SNPs. Processed samples will be automatically stored within
a repository, as well as produce a clinical report on drug-susceptibility.
